#Here are some attempts to export the files which failed completely. However, I learned a lot from this and thus include them in this script:

#THE CSV EPISODE:

  #When trying to export the data with the write.csv(), I got the error: unimplemented type 'list' in 'EncodeElement', I learn from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24829027/unimplemented-type-list-when-trying-to-write-table to do the following

#flattening data: 

#denmark

#PROBLEM: Can't import via read.csv() --> gets weird. 

read.csv(denmark_df_two, "denmark.csv") #does not work - import manually makes it weird!

#Tried to solve it:
#write.csv. doesn't work, error:  
#Error in write.table(denmark_df, "denmark.csv", col.names = NA, sep = ",",  : unimplemented type 'list' in 'EncodeElement'

#tried converting it from tibble to data-frame: 
as.data.frame(denmark_df)

#tried the write.csv again and it still doe'snt work :
write.csv(denmark_df)
  
#TRYING:

#LESSON THE 19TH

library(RJSONIO)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
